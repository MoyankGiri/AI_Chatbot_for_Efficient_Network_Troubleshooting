# AI Chatbot for Efficient Network Troubleshooting
## Problem Motivation
The motivation for our project stems from the critical role that base stations play within our network architecture,
acting as pivotal points for sending and receiving messages in accordance with protocols and
standards established by international and standard bodies such as 3GPP and IETF. Given the vast array
of knowledge and specifications required for troubleshooting networks, network administrators often
face significant challenges. Manual troubleshooting processes are not only time-consuming but also prone
to inefficiencies, leading to delays in resolving network issues. To address this challenge, we propose the
development of a network-based chatbot. This innovative solution aims to streamline the troubleshooting
process by providing instant access to relevant information and guidance, thereby enhancing the efficiency
and effectiveness of network administrators in maintaining and optimizing network performance.
